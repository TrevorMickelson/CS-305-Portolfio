## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
The client Artemis Financial had the main concern of software security. They wanted the software to have all the latest most up to date security best
practices, and needed their client information to be completely secure.

## What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I patched their vulnerabilities by first running vulnerability tests, and then acting on those tests/adding things like encyrption. Having insecure code can bring a compnay to its knees with one simple leak. The value of secure software cannot be over stated and is essential to any company.

## What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging part for me was the report, I find that writing anything is more difficult than actually programming.

## How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased layers of security by adding encyrptions and making sure the website uses HTTPS rather than HTTP. I would do the same things in the future as I already did here. I'd simply make sure they were prioritized more to avoid any kind of mess later on.

## How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I made sure everything was functional and secure by testing all the code, and following all the security practices mentioned from above.

## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I believe encryption will be useful for future assignements and tasks. I also used SOLID princples where I could, which is always very useful for writing clean code.

## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I mean being realistic I probably wouldn't show these assignments on a porfolio as most jobs want to see real projects that actually do something, while using multiple technologies.
